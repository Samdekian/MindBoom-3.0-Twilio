   - Rewrite inefficient queries
   - Consider caching strategies

4. Review and optimize cache configuration:
   ```typescript
   import { roleCacheManager } from '@/utils/rbac/role-cache-manager';
   
   // Adjust TTL based on usage patterns
   roleCacheManager.setTTL(600); // 10 minutes
   
   // Adjust cache size if needed
   roleCacheManager.setMaxSize(1000);
   ```

5. Implement query optimizations in database functions.
