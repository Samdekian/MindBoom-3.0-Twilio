   - Tracks role synchronization operations
   - Includes success/failure status and error messages
   - Used to monitor synchronization health

3. **Database Performance Metrics**
   - Monitor execution time of RBAC-related queries
   - Track database locks and contention on RBAC tables
   - Measure query plan efficiency for common RBAC operations

### Application Level Monitoring

1. **Client-Side Metrics**
   - Track RBAC initialization time
   - Measure permission check latency
   - Monitor role cache performance
   - Log permission check failures

2. **Server-Side Metrics**
   - Monitor RPC function performance
   - Track role assignment operations
   - Measure consistency check execution time
   - Log role synchronization events

3. **Error Tracking**
   - Log RBAC-related errors with context
   - Track error rates by operation type
   - Monitor error trends over time

## Alert Configuration

### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response Required)

- **Multiple Unauthorized Access Attempts**: More than 5 unauthorized access attempts within an hour

### Warning Alerts (Monitoring Required)

- **Elevated Error Rate**: RBAC error rate exceeds 1% over 10 minutes
- **Performance Degradation**: Permission checks taking over 100ms consistently

- **Suspicious Role Changes**: More than 3 role changes for a single user in a day

### Informational Alerts

- **Role Sync Completed**: Summary of successful role synchronization operations
- **Consistency Check Results**: Results of scheduled consistency checks
- **Cache Clear Events**: Notification when role cache is cleared manually

## Monitoring Dashboard Elements

- **API Request Volume**: Number of RBAC-related API calls over time

### Reliability Panel

- **System Status**: Current status of RBAC components
- **Error Rate Graph**: Time series of RBAC error rates
- **Sync Success Rate**: Success/failure ratio of role synchronization operations
