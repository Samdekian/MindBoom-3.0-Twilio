# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback
* **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community
* **Showing empathy** towards other community members
* **Using welcoming and inclusive** language
* **Being patient and understanding** with new contributors
* **Respecting confidentiality** especially regarding patient health information

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Sharing or discussing Protected Health Information (PHI) inappropriately
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Sustained disruption of discussions or other events
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

## Healthcare-Specific Standards

Given the nature of this project as a healthcare application:

* **Patient Privacy**: Always respect and protect patient privacy and confidentiality
* **HIPAA Compliance**: Never share Protected Health Information (PHI) in public forums,
  issues, or discussions
* **Professional Conduct**: Maintain professional standards appropriate for healthcare technology
* **Security First**: Report security vulnerabilities privately, never publicly
* **Test Data**: Never use real patient data for testing or development purposes
* **Clinical Accuracy**: Be especially careful with features related to clinical care

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting

### How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,
please report it by contacting the project team at:

**conduct@mindboom.com**

For security vulnerabilities, please email: **security@mindboom.com**

### What to Include in Your Report

* Your contact information
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* Your account of what occurred, including:
  - When and where it happened
  - Whether the incident is ongoing
  - If there are additional witnesses or other available records (e.g., screenshots)
* Any additional information that may be helpful

### Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with discretion. We will:

* Keep your identity confidential unless you specifically consent to disclosure
* Not share details beyond what is necessary for resolution
* Provide updates on the resolution process when appropriate
* Take reports seriously and respond promptly

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

## Special Considerations for Healthcare Context

### Patient Safety

Actions that could compromise patient safety or violate healthcare regulations
(such as HIPAA) will result in immediate removal from the project and may be
reported to appropriate authorities.

### Professional Standards

Contributors are expected to maintain professional standards appropriate for
healthcare technology development, including:

* Accurate and honest communication
* Respect for patient privacy and confidentiality
* Adherence to relevant healthcare regulations
* Responsible disclosure of security issues
