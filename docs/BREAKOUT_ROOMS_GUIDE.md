# Breakout Rooms User Guide

A comprehensive guide for therapists on using breakout rooms in group therapy sessions.

## What are Breakout Rooms?

Breakout rooms allow you to split a group therapy session into smaller, separate virtual rooms where participants can have focused discussions. This feature is perfect for:

- Group therapy exercises
- Peer support discussions
- Role-playing scenarios
- Small group activities
- Team building exercises

## Prerequisites

- Active therapist account
- Group session with at least 2 participants
- Participants must be connected to the main session

## Creating Breakout Rooms

### Step 1: Access Breakout Room Manager

1. Start or join a group therapy session
2. Look for the **"Breakout Rooms"** panel in the session controls
3. Click **"Create Breakout Rooms"** button

### Step 2: Configure Breakout Rooms

You'll see a configuration dialog with the following options:

#### Number of Rooms
- **Range**: 1-10 rooms
- **Recommended**: 2-5 rooms for most sessions
- **Tip**: Consider your total participant count

#### Max Participants Per Room
- **Range**: 2-15 participants
- **Recommended**: 3-5 participants for intimate discussions
- **Note**: Smaller groups encourage more participation

#### Assignment Strategy

**Automatic (Random)**
- Participants are randomly distributed across rooms
- Best for mixing participants who don't know each other
- Fair and unbiased distribution
- Quick setup

**Manual**
- You assign participants to rooms yourself
- Best for targeted groupings
- Allows strategic pairing
- More control over group dynamics

### Step 3: Create and Assign

1. Review your configuration in the preview section
2. Click **"Create Rooms"** button
3. Wait for rooms to be created (usually 2-5 seconds)
4. If you chose automatic assignment, participants will be distributed immediately
